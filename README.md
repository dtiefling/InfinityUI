# InfinityUI - dtiefling blue branch

This is an alternative branch of great, yet still beta
[Infinity UI++](https://github.com/Renegade0/InfinityUI). My versions are stil
mostly the code by [Renegade0](https://github.com/Renegade0), but I have forked
[RogerPaladin's branch](https://github.com/RogerPaladin/InfinityUI), as it
was more recent at the point of making the fork.

`blue` branch of this project contains the version I use. It contains aesthetic
changes (dialog fonts, key bindings, and - most notably - changed color of
the main skin, from red to soft blueish).

Changes that I believe to be fixes rather than my presonal preferences are
pushed to the `main` branch as well.

The presented changes are tested mostly on EET install
(Linux native PC version).
